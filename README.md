### All Algorithms implemented in C# - for education purposes

The repository is a collection of a variety of algorithms implemented in C#. The algorithms span over a variety of topics
from computer science, mathematics and statistics, data science, machine learning, engineering, etc. The implementations
and their associated documentations are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may
find more than one implementation for the same objective but using different algorithm strategies and optimizations.
